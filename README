To run the framework:
java -Dlava.library.path=lib/native/your-os -jar asteroidsfw.jar [parameters]

Substitute your-os with your operating system (look under lib/native to see the supported ones). If using java2d graphics (see below), you don't need to set the native path at all.

Parameters are:
file=filename   - reads configuration data from file filename
graphics=opengl|java2d  - sets the graphics mode to OpenGL or java2d. OpenGL is the default mode. If using java2d, you don't need the native opengl libraries.

Look inside the file named "input" to see information about the accepted configuration parameters. NB: you need to see the parameters, because that is how you load your ship into the framework.

For example, I start the framework on my laptop with the following command:

java -Djava.library.path=lib/native/linux -jar asteroidsfw.jar file=input

...and I start with a yellow human ship playing against John's purple one.


java -Djava.library.path=D:\GameProjects\asteroids\lib\native\windows -jar asteroidsfw.jar file=D:\GameProjects\asteroids\input
